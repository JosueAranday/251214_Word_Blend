# CSCI 3333 Homework BLND: Blend Words
## 1 Introduction

A blend word is a word made by combining other words; e.g. turboast (turbo + boast), witchins (witch + 
chins), and helloaf (hello + loaf). In this assignment, you’ll construct such blend words consisting of words 
that overlap by exactly two characters.

Blend words can also be made three or more words, e.g. gumbotchamp (gumbo + botch + champ), 
hoistakebabyss (hoist + stake + kebab + abyss), and eleventiceliactualpacayugazebonsaikido (eleven + 
entice + celiac + actual + alpaca + cayuga + gazebo + bonsai + aikido).

## 2 Instructions

The following files have been given to you:
- A C++ header file (wordblender.h) declaring the WordBlender class.
- A C++ source file (main.cpp) containing a main function with tests.
- A text file (eleven-words.txt) containing 11 words.
- A text file (five-letter-words.txt) containing 1155 five-letter words.
- A text file (six-letter-words.txt) containing 1201 six-letter words.

Download the files [here](https://faculty.utrgv.edu/robert.schweller/CS3333/hwBLNDfiles.html). 
Create a new C++ source file named wordblender.cpp that implements the class declared in wordblender.h, 
so that wordblender.cpp and the provided files compile into a program that runs with no failed tests. 
Submit the source file wordblender.cpp.

## 3 Submission and Grading

Submit the aforementioned source file(s) via Blackboard as attached file(s). In the case of multiple submissions, 
the last submission before the deadline is graded. 

For grading, each submission is compiled with the provided files and run. Submissions that do not run to 
completion (i.e. fail to print “Assignment complete.”) receive no credit. Submissions that take an 
unreasonable amount of time (e.g. more than a minute or so) to run and do not meet the asymptotic efficiency 
requirements receive no credit. All other submissions receive full credit. 

See the course late work policy for information about receiving partial credit for late submissions.
